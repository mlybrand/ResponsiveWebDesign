# Lemonade Stand Tax Collection

In a narrow vote on a very controversial issue, the Washington state legislature has mandated the collection of a new tax.

As revenue shortfalls continue, the state government is constantly looking for new revenue streams. A recently untapped source has recently been identified: **Children's Lemonade Stands**

Children should:

* be able to log in
* enter daily income and calculate taxes
* pay taxes incurred


DOR administrators should:

* access various tabular lists of taxes paid
* generate graphical data on the effectiveness of the taxation program.
